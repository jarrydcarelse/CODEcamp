# Code Camp Website

## Overview

**Code Camp** is an online IT school offering intensive 4-month bootcamps in A+, Python, React, ICDL, Java, and Project Management. The website serves as an information hub where potential students can explore bootcamp offerings, learn about the school, and get in touch with the team via a contact form.

The website was developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (for optional interactivity). The design is modern, user-friendly, and responsive, ensuring accessibility across different devices.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, making it easy to navigate on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Custom Background Header Image**: The home page features a large background image in the header, with a semi-transparent overlay to ensure the text stands out.
- **Modern Fonts and Color Palette**: The site uses **Montserrat** for headings and **Roboto** for body text to maintain a clean and professional look. The color palette includes teal, dark gray, white, and yellow call-to-action buttons.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form on the website allows visitors to submit inquiries. It can be integrated with a backend (such as PHP) for email handling.
